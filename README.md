# pub-timeslave
This is the public repo for the FPGA embedded IP known as "TimeSlave".
TimeSlave is an implementation of an IEEE 1588v2 PTP Ordinary Slave device.
The repo includes the Verilog RTL needed to create the example designs.
Notably, CSIRO has incorporated this IP onto multiple Alveo U55C boards.
Additional documentation is in the /doc directory.
## AMD-Xilinx Alveo Boards Tested
